<h1>Comparing Go's Speed</h1>
<p>Go is <em>generally</em> faster and more lightweight than interpreted or VM-powered languages like:</p>
<ul>
<li>Python</li>
<li>JavaScript</li>
<li>PHP</li>
<li>Ruby</li>
<li>Java</li>
</ul>
<p>However, in terms of execution speed, Go does lag behind some other compiled languages like:</p>
<ul>
<li>C</li>
<li>C++</li>
<li>Rust</li>
</ul>
<p>Go is a bit slower mostly due to its automated memory management, also known as the "Go runtime". Slightly slower speed is the price we pay for memory safety and simple syntax!</p>

<p>Textio is an amazing candidate for a Go project. We'll be able to quickly process large amounts of text all while using a language that is safe and simple to write.</p>
